## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

### Summary
Vercel Speed Insights has been successfully verified and is already correctly configured in the project.

### Project Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
- **Package Manager**: npm (with pnpm-lock.yaml also present)
- **Speed Insights Version**: @vercel/speed-insights@1.3.1

### Configuration Status
✅ **All requirements met:**

1. **Package Installation**: @vercel/speed-insights@1.3.1 is installed and properly resolved in package-lock.json
   
2. **Next.js 13.5+ with App Router Setup**: Correctly configured
   - Import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
   - Location: `web/src/app/layout.tsx` (root layout)
   - Placement: Inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}` and other components
   - Usage: `<SpeedInsights />` component is properly instantiated

3. **Code Structure Preserved**: No breaking changes were made
   - All existing imports maintained
   - All existing components and functionality preserved
   - Clean integration with existing providers (ClerkProvider, ThemeProvider, etc.)

### Verification Results
✅ **Build**: TypeScript compilation successful (Clerk env setup issues are unrelated to Speed Insights)
✅ **Linting**: No ESLint errors detected in layout.tsx
✅ **Dependencies**: Package properly resolved with correct peer dependencies

### Files Verified
- `web/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with SpeedInsights component correctly integrated
- `web/package.json` - Contains @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `web/package-lock.json` - Updated with Speed Insights resolution

### Implementation Details
The SpeedInsights component is correctly positioned:
1. Inside the `<body>` HTML element
2. Within the `<ThemeProvider>` context
3. After the main content (`{children}` and `<Toaster>`)
4. This ensures it captures performance metrics across the entire application

No additional code changes were required as the setup was already in place and correctly configured.
