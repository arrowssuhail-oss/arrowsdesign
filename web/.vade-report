# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully verified and confirmed that Vercel Speed Insights is properly installed and configured in the Next.js 16.1.1 project using the App Router pattern.

## What Was Found
The project already has:
1. **@vercel/speed-insights** package installed (version 1.3.1)
2. **@vercel/analytics** package installed (version 1.6.1)
3. **SpeedInsights component** properly imported and configured in the root layout

## Current Configuration

### File: `web/src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Import Statement**: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";`
- **Component Usage**: `<SpeedInsights />` is correctly placed inside the `<body>` tag
- **Location**: After `{children}` and `<Toaster>` components, before `<Analytics />`

### Project Details
- **Next.js Version**: 16.1.1 (with Turbopack)
- **Router Type**: App Router (confirmed by presence of `web/src/app/layout.tsx`)
- **React Version**: 19.2.3
- **Package Manager**: npm (with legacy-peer-deps enabled in .npmrc)

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Vercel Speed Insights is already properly configured and ready to use.

### What Was Done
1. Explored the project structure to determine Next.js version and router type
2. Verified that @vercel/speed-insights package is installed
3. Confirmed the SpeedInsights component is correctly imported from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
4. Verified the component is placed in the correct location (root layout, inside body tag)
5. Confirmed package-lock.json includes both @vercel/speed-insights and @vercel/analytics
6. Verified TypeScript compilation and linter work correctly

## Technical Details

### Why This Configuration Works
- **Next.js 16.1.1 with App Router**: Requires importing from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
- **Server Component**: The root layout is a Server Component, which is appropriate for SpeedInsights
- **Placement**: Positioning after children ensures all page content is tracked
- **Analytics Companion**: Both SpeedInsights and Analytics are configured together for comprehensive monitoring

## Build & Verification
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced by SpeedInsights
- ✅ package-lock.json properly reflects dependency resolution

## No Changes Required
The implementation is already complete and follows best practices. The project is ready to:
1. Collect Core Web Vitals data with Vercel Speed Insights
2. Track user analytics with Vercel Analytics
3. Send performance metrics to Vercel dashboard
